# Media Framing of Poverty Alleviation in China: A Textual Analysis of "People's Daily"

## Project Description

This research project explores the framing of poverty alleviation in the "People's Daily," the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China. Utilizing a corpus of approximately 5000 articles from 1979 to 2023, this study identifies and analyzes the underlying development ideas and the frames of poverty alleviation. The project employs deductive content analysis methods to track the continuity and change in poverty alleviation discourse, providing insights into how media frames might influence public perceptions and policy directions in the context of China's evolving economic policies and social dynamics.

## Research Questions

1. What are the underlying development ideas, and how does People’s Daily uphold them in its reports on poverty alleviation?
2. What frames are used to discuss poverty alleviation, and how are they employed by People’s Daily in its reporting?
3. What changes and continuities in terms of development ideas or frames of poverty alleviation are reflected in the party paper’s reports on poverty?
